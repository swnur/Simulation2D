# ** Project "Simulation" **
A step-by-step simulation of a 2D world populated by herbivores and predators. In addition to creatures, the world contains resources (grass) that herbivores feed on, and static objects that cannot be interacted withâ€”they simply occupy space.

The application is written in Java using an object-oriented programming style. The BFS algorithm is used for pathfinding.
