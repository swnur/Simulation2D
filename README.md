# **Project "Simulation"**
A step-by-step simulation of a 2D world populated by herbivores and predators. In addition to creatures, the world contains resources (grass) that herbivores feed on, and static objects that cannot be interacted withâ€”they simply occupy space.

The application is written in Java using an object-oriented programming style. The BFS algorithm is used for pathfinding.

## Future Enhancements

### 1. More Types of Predators with Leveling Up
- Introduce multiple predator species, each with unique characteristics.
- Implement a leveling-up system where predators become stronger and gain new abilities as they survive longer in the simulation.

### 2. Switching to A* Pathfinding
- Replace the current BFS algorithm with the more efficient A* algorithm for pathfinding.
- This change will improve the realism of creature movement and make the simulation more efficient, especially on larger maps.
